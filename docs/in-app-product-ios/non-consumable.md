# Non-Consumable In-App Product

- Creating Non-Consumable In-App Product is similar to creating Consumable In-App Product.
- One option you will see extra is **Family Sharing**.

:::info Family Sharing 
- Allow family members to share this in-app purchase without having to use each other's accounts.
- For example purchasing a movie on iTunes and then share it with your family members through Family Sharing.
