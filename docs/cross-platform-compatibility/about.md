# In-App Purchase In Multiple Platforms

![spider_man](/img/spiderman_meme.jpg)

### Challenges of cross-platform In-App Purchases

1. **Platform Restrictions**: Apple and Google prohibit purchases made outside their ecosystems unless using web-based payments.
2. **Revenue Sharing**: Each store takes a cut (e.g., Apple & Google take 15-30%).
3. **Purchase Syncing**: If a user buys content on one platform, it must be accessible on others.
4. **Regulations & Compliance**: Some regions have strict rules on payment processing.

- As of February 2025, Neither Apple app store or Google play store, provides anything to manage subscription for multiple platforms.

### Solutions to manage in-app purchase across multiple platform

- As of now we have to manage flags from our backend side to manage user's subscription details.
- For example, we can manage a flag to decide if let user consume content on multiple platforms or not.

### Subscription cancellation 

- Users can only cancel the subscription from the platform where they subscribed. If app is on multiple platforms, inform user to cancel from the platform they subscribed (If possible, differentiate the platform using flag in backend, to show the actual platform to users).
- All the way if your application supports iOS, Android and Web then there are more than 80% chance that Web version is using Stripe like SDKs as it is 50-60% much cheaper than Apple app store and Google play store.
- That's why in this case, if user has purchased from Web, you have to restrict user from canceling subscription from iOS and Android.

### Best Practices

- Store all purchase data on a centralized server rather than relying solely on platform APIs.
- Implement server-side validation to prevent fraud and ensure purchases are recognized across devices.
- Services like Google Play Developer API, Apple's App Store Server API, and PlayFab can help validate purchases.
- Allow users to log in with a universal account (e.g., via email, social login, or third-party authentication like Firebase Auth). This ensures purchases made on one platform are accessible on another.
- Use webhooks or polling to track changes in subscription status (e.g., cancellations, renewals).
- Platforms like Apple and Google provide server-to-server notifications to stay updated on users' subscription status.
- If possible, offer web-based payment methods (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) for direct transactions, keeping compliance in mind.

By following these best practices, developers can create a seamless and secure cross-platform in-app purchase experience while optimizing revenue and user satisfaction.
