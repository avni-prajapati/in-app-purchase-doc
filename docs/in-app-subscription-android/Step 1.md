## Create in-app subscription in Google Play Console

:::info 

- A subscription is a set of benefits that users can access during a stated time period. 
- You can have multiple subscriptions within the same app, either to represent entirely different benefits (for example, a streaming video app could have separate news and sports subscriptions), or different tiers of a single set of benefits (for example, a cloud storage app could have 100 GB, 1 TB, and 10 TB subscriptions).

:::

- To create subscription go to Google Play Console > Monetize with Play > Products > Subscription and click to **Create subscription**.

- Create product ID and name for subscription.

:::danger Take care
- You canâ€™t change or reuse a **Product ID** after the product has been created.
- Also on deleting product you can not use same **Product ID**.
- To know more about naming convention for ProductID head over to [common practices](docs/common-practices/common-practices.md).
