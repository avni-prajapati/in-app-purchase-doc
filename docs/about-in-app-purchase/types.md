# Types of In-App Purchases?

![shopping](/img/about-in-app-purchase/shopping.jpg)

There are four types of in-app purchases.
Let's understand differences in all four.

### 1. Consumables

Consumables are products that can be used (‘consumed’) once and then repurchased multiple times.

:::info Example
- Clash of Clans – Buying Gems to speed up upgrades.
- Candy Crush – Buying extra lives or boosters.
:::

### 2. Non-consumables

Non-consumables are products that are purchased once, have no expiry date, and remain permanently available within your app.

:::info Example
- Spotify – One-time purchase to remove ads in the free version.
- Minecraft – Unlocking skin packs or maps permanently.
:::

### 3. Auto-renewable subscription

Auto-renewal subscriptions are products or services that you pay for on a recurring basis.
Developers love these, as they guarantee a steady income stream. 

:::info Example
- Netflix – Monthly/annual subscription for unlimited streaming.
- Tinder – Tinder Gold/Plus for premium dating features.
:::

### 4. Non-renewing Subscriptions

Non auto-renewal subscriptions are those that run for a fixed period of time, after which you can choose to manually renew. 
Often, these last longer and cost more than auto-renewal subscriptions.  

:::info Example
- Duolingo Plus – A 6-month language learning plan that expires unless manually renewed.
- Udemy – Buying a specific course for lifetime access without recurring fees.
